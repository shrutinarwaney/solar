		<h1>Questions that we asked ourselves</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				How much energy does the average factory need?
				<ul>
					<li>Annually a factory uses 23,202 MW</li>
					<li>Energy Consumption a Month: 1,933.5 MW</li>
					<li>Energy Consumption a Week: 483.37 MW</li>
					<li>Energy Consumption a Day: 69 MW </li>
					<li>Energy Consumption a Hour: 2.9 MW</li>
					<li>25% of the annual factory electricity consumption is used in the buildings technology system, for example lights, heating, and 
						cooling.</li>
					<li>
						So, annually 5,800.5 MW are used to run the facility’s technology system.
						<ul>
							<li>5,800.5 MW -> 5,800,500,000 W</li>
							<li>111.5 MW a week</li>
							<li>15.9 MW a day </li>
							<li>We plan to cover the facility’s light technology system and electronic appliances with solar energy.</li>
							<li>
								32w every 126 week/h
								<ul>
									<li>Annually 242.424 kw </li>
									<li>The other 5,800.257576 MW will be powered from hydro power.</li>
									<li>A total of 23,201.757576 MW by hydropower.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>	
			</li>
			<li>
				How much energy do solar panels produce?
				<ul>
					<li>
						The solar panels we are using are from SunPower.
						<ul>
							<li>Out of their models, we are using their E-series. </li>
							<li>The e-series can generate 327w per hour at its peak.</li>
							<li>The e-series has 20.4% efficiency.  </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
			</li>
			<li>
				Based on the previous question, how many units of solar panels should there be on the factory?
				<ul>
					<li>There should be 40 solar panel units in the factory.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Based on that previous question, how much will this cost in total?
				<ul>
					<li>This will cost an approximate of $5,099,220.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Are there any other efficient ways that we can add to solar?
				<ul>
					<li>We could add hydropower, geothermal or nuclear, but geothermal and nuclear are not the most feasible, so we could do some form of hydropower, probably not a full scale hydropower plant, along with solar. Our factory will be in Phoenix, Arizona because it gets a lot of sunlight, and there is the Salt River that we could build a dam in and that could be the source of hydropower, and we would probably do the small type of hydropower. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				In how many different ways can we hold energy in a self sustaining factory?
				<ul>
					<li>We can hold energy is self sustaining factories in many different ways. For example, we can have solar panels so that we can use resources really well and we can use the sun to power the factory. Apart from this, if we built a solar farm, that could get a lot of energy and there could still be things going on below the solar panels, like parking. Also, small hydropower is an option. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				What are some energy storage techniques that are used widely?
				<ul>
					<li>Some energy storage techniques that are used widely include solid state batteries, which are electrochemical batteries that include advanced chemistry batteries and capacitors, flow batteries, where the energy is stored directly into the electrolyte solution, compressed air energy storage, where you use compressed air to store energy, thermal, where you capture the heat and cold to acquire energy on demand, and pumped hydro-power, where you rely on gravity causing the water to cascade, creating an on-demand energy source that can be released very quickly. </li>
