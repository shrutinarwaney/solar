		<h1>Space</h1>
		<p>SPACE: The solar method does take up quite a lot of space, but, below the solar panels, there can be other things going on, such as places to park, as shown in the above picture. With the 741 solar panels, the approximate amount of space is 1,207,583,988 mm^2 which is 0.3 acres, which fits in the 2.3 acres that the average factory has. The solar panels are in a farm and therefore will not be on the roof of the factory. That is why it is taking about around 0.3 acres. 741 solar panels should be enough to power the whole factory and there shouldnâ€™t be more than one solar farm locations within the entire space.</p>

	<div class="content ct" id="ct3">
		<h1>Cost</h1>
		<p>COST: The solar panels will cost about $1,103,029.20, and we are implementing the E-Series Solar Panels from Sun Power, and we choose this because it is more energy-efficient  and takes up less space than alternatives.
		<br><br>PROBLEMS: A problem that could rise regarding the solar panels is that as the factory continues to expand and supplies more workers with more computers and other technology, more solar panels may need to be implemented. If more and more people join the factory in the long term, this could potentially increase the cost drastically as well as take up space needed for the factory.</p>

	<div class="content ct" id="ct4">
		<h1>Enviornmental Impact</h1>
		<p>The solar panels are very environmentally safe because, not only do they not harm any living ecosystems like wind power do and there is no chance of earthquakes like there is with some geothermal ways of getting energy, they are also leed certified, which means that they are very energy-efficient. The only risks associated with this, as identified in the first question, are that the only dangers that are present in these solar panels are the materials that they are made of, such as silver, copper, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, and mercury.</p>
