		<h1>Space</h1>
		<p>Solar in most cases will take up lots of space when generating a lot of power, but with our system we only need 3 solar panels from Sunpower. The total amount of space the solar panels will take up is 192.447672m2, which fits in the 2.3 acres that the average factory has. The 3 solar panels will not be able to power all of the electrical needs in the building, but will be able to power the facilityâ€™s lights and electrical appliances.</p>

		<h1>Cost</h1>
		<p>The solar panels will cost about $566,580, and we are implementing the E-Series Solar Panels from Sunpower. We choose this because it is more energy efficient and takes up less space than alternatives.</p>

		<h1>Enviornmental Impact</h1>
		<p>The solar panels are very environmentally safe because, not only do they not harm any living ecosystems like wind power do and there is no chance of earthquakes like there is with some geothermal ways of getting energy, they are also leed certified, which means that they are very energy-efficient. The only risks associated with this, as identified in the first question, are that the only dangers that are present in these solar panels are the materials that they are made of, such as silver, copper, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, and mercury.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>A problem that could rise regarding the solar panels is that as the factory continues to expand and supplies more workers with more computers and other technology, more solar panels may need to be implemented. If more and more people join the factory in the long term, this could potentially increase the cost drastically as well as take up space needed for the factory.</p>
