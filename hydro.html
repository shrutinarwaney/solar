		<h1>Space</h1>
		<p>
			A small hydropower system would be in a stream or a river, so it would not interfere with human 
			activity very much and does not take up much space, and, because the small hydropower systems 
			are so small, it is very rare that the salmon would get caught. The hydropower systems will also 
			include certain prevention systems such as salmon cannons and other fish cannons  as well as other 
			camera technology to prevent smaller fish from getting stuck within it. The systems will also be 
			developed with protective material and will most certainly be eco friendly. The approximate amount 
			of space is about 40 meters, but it ranges depending on how high the current is and where you are.

		<h1>Cost</h1>
		<p>
			The small hydropower will cost about $1,300 for 8,000 kw of energy, which is the same as 8 megawatts, 
			and $500 to install, resulting in $1,800. The only thing is that, every four years, the price goes up 1%.

		<h1>Enviornmental Impact</h1>
		<p>
			The small hydropower method is mainly environmentally safe, as it does not use any fossil fuels or 
			non-renewable energy resources, but there have been reports of salmon dying, but that is very rare, 
			and this usually happens in regular hydropower systems. There are also prevention systems that can keep 
			the fish from dying.
